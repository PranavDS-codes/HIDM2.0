# Methodology

## Overview
The methodology of this project revolves around the enhancement of an existing hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS) for cloud environments. We aimed to improve the original model by incorporating additional datasets, evaluating multiple machine learning models, optimizing them, and applying ensemble methods to create a more robust and effective intrusion detection framework. This section details the steps taken to achieve these goals, including data preprocessing, model selection, training, optimization, and ensemble techniques.

## Data Preprocessing
The preprocessing phase involved several steps to ensure the datasets were clean, consistent, and suitable for training machine learning models:

1. **Label Transformation**: All datasets were labeled in a binary format, classifying benign instances as `0` and malicious instances as `1`. This simplified the classification task by focusing on distinguishing between normal and malicious behaviors.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were handled using imputation techniques. For numeric features, the mean value was used, while categorical features were imputed using the most frequent value.

3. **Normalization**: To prevent certain features from dominating due to their larger magnitude, all features were normalized to bring them into a comparable range.

4. **Train-Test Split**: Each dataset was divided into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. This ensured that models were evaluated on unseen data, providing an accurate assessment of their generalization capabilities.

## Model Selection
We selected a diverse set of machine learning models to comprehensively evaluate their effectiveness for intrusion detection. The chosen models include:

- **AdaBoost**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Extremely Randomized Trees**
- **Neural Networks**

These models were selected due to their strong track record in handling classification problems, especially in cybersecurity contexts. Each model was trained on the preprocessed datasets to evaluate its performance in identifying intrusion attempts.

## Model Training and Evaluation
1. **Initial Training**: All models were trained on the preprocessed training sets. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Area Under the Curve (AUC), and confusion matrices were used to evaluate the models on the test set.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
   - **Precision**: Indicates how many of the positive predictions were actually correct.
   - **Recall**: Measures the ability of the model to identify all relevant cases (true positives).
   - **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
   - **AUC**: Represents the ability of the model to distinguish between classes.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions, highlighting true and false positives and negatives.

## Model Optimization
Model performance was further improved using advanced hyperparameter optimization techniques. These optimization methods ensured that each model's hyperparameters were tuned to achieve the best possible performance:

1. **Hyperband Optimization**: Applied to AdaBoost, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extremely Randomized Tree. Hyperband uses early-stopping to efficiently allocate resources to promising configurations.

2. **Grid Search Cross-Validation (CV)**: Applied to AdaBoost for an exhaustive search over specified hyperparameter values, ensuring optimal configuration.

3. **Gradient-Based Optimization**: Used for AdaBoost to find the optimal set of hyperparameters through gradient descent techniques.

4. **Optuna Optimization**: Employed for Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extremely Randomized Tree to maximize accuracy using trial-based optimization.

5. **Bayesian Optimization**: Applied to Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Extremely Randomized Tree, focusing on optimizing hyperparameters through probabilistic models.

## Ensemble Techniques
To improve the overall performance and resilience of the intrusion detection system, various ensemble methods were applied to combine multiple models:

1. **Hard Voting**: A simple majority voting approach where each model casts a vote for a class, and the final prediction is based on the majority.

2. **Soft Voting**: Averages the predicted probabilities of each class from all models, selecting the class with the highest average probability.

3. **Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA)**: Weighed models based on their posterior probabilities, giving more influence to models that were more likely given the data.

4. **Dynamic Method**: Adjusted the weights of each model in the ensemble based on the confidence of their predictions for each instance, providing higher influence to more confident models.

5. **Weighted Average**: Assigned weights to models based on their reliability, giving greater influence to models that performed better during testing.

## Summary
The methodology employed in this project includes extensive data preprocessing, model selection and evaluation, hyperparameter optimization, and the use of ensemble techniques to create a robust hybrid intrusion detection model. By systematically integrating multiple models and leveraging their strengths through ensemble learning, we successfully improved detection accuracy, minimized false positives, and enhanced the overall security of cloud-based systems.
